1. Core Concept & Value PropositionConcept: A web-based navigation tool that generates optimized driving routes to ensure 100% visual coverage of all accessible roads within a user-defined urban area.Value: Reduces search time, prevents volunteers from doubling back unnecessarily, and ensures no streets are accidentally missed during a high-stress search operation.2. User JourneyDefine Area: The user searches for a suburb (e.g., "Brooklyn Heights") or draws a custom bounding box on a map.Generate Route: The system identifies all driveable roads within that polygon and calculates a continuous route that covers them all with minimal overlap.Navigate: The user receives a visual overlay of the path. As they drive, "driven" road segments turn from red (unsearched) to green (searched).Track & Share: The completed search map can be exported or shared with other search coordinators to avoid duplication of effort.3. Feature BreakdownPhase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)Map Interface: Interactive map (OpenStreetMap base) with search functionality.Area Selection:Geocoding: Select standard administrative boundaries (suburbs/zip codes).Polygon Tool: Draw a custom shape on the map.Routing Engine: Algorithm to convert the road network inside the polygon into a single GPX/GeoJSON route.Navigation View: A "follow the line" interface. (Note: Full turn-by-turn voice guidance is complex to build; the MVP should focus on a visual "breadcrum" trail on the map).Progress Tracking: GPS tracking to "paint" the roads as the user drives over them.Phase 2: Collaboration & Advanced FeaturesMulti-Car Partitioning: Split a large search area into 4 quadrants and generate separate routes for 4 different cars.Live Team Tracking: See where other searchers are in real-time.Point of Interest Dropping: Ability to drop pins (e.g., "Witness Sighting," "CCTV Camera Found").4. Technical ArchitectureThe "Hard" Problem: RoutingYou are not doing Point-to-Point routing; you are doing Edge-Covering.The Math: This relies on solving the Chinese Postman Problem or Rural Postman Problem. You need to convert the street map into a graph (nodes = intersections, edges = roads) and find an Eulerian path.Data Source: OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the best choice here because it provides raw vector data (nodes/ways) that you can manipulate mathematically, unlike Google Maps which is restrictive.Recommended Tech StackComponentTechnologyWhy?FrontendReact + Leaflet (or Mapbox GL JS)Reactive UI for drawing polygons; Leaflet is lightweight and great for OSM.BackendPython (FastAPI or Django)Python has the best geospatial libraries (NetworkX, OSMnx) for solving graph problems.DatabasePostgreSQL + PostGISThe industry standard for storing spatial data (polygons, road networks).Graph LogicOSMnx + NetworkXPython libraries specifically designed to download OSM street networks and solve routing algorithms.5. Algorithmic Strategy (The "How-To")This is the logic your backend will need to execute when a user clicks "Plan Route":Ingest: Take the user's polygon (search area).Fetch Graph: Use the polygon to query OpenStreetMap (via Overpass API or OSMnx) to get all "driveable" roads inside that box.Clean: Remove disconnected sub-graphs (e.g., a gated community not accessible from the main road) or pedestrian-only paths.Eulerize: If the graph has "odd degree" nodes (intersections with an odd number of roads connecting to them), the graph is not fully traversable in a single loop without repeating roads. The algorithm must add "virtual edges" (doubling back on certain streets) to make the graph traversable.Solve: Generate the Eulerian circuit.Return: Send the ordered list of coordinates (the route) back to the frontend to render as a polyline.6. UX & Safety ConsiderationsDriver Safety Mode: The UI must be high-contrast and minimal. Complex interactions should be disabled while the car is moving."Passenger Required" Prompt: Ideally, advise the user that this requires a two-person team (one driver, one spotter/navigator) so the driver watches the road, not the screen.Offline Capability: Search areas often have poor reception. The app should cache the route locally (PWA or LocalStorage) once generated.7. Development RoadmapMonth 1: The EngineSet up Python environment with OSMnx.Write a script that takes a lat/long bounding box and outputs a list of lat/long points representing the "Chinese Postman" route.Month 2: The InterfaceBuild the React frontend.Implement Leaflet map with drawing tools (Leaflet-Draw).Connect the frontend to the Python backend API.Month 3: The TrackerImplement browser Geolocation API to show the user's blue dot.Add logic to change the color of the route line from "Blue" (Planned) to "Grey" (Covered) as the GPS dot passes over it.
